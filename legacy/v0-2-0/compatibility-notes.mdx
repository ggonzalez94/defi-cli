title: Compatibility Notes (v0.2.0)
description: What differs between v0.2.0 and latest docs.
---

If you run `v0.2.0`, rely on this section instead of `latest` behavior.

## Not in v0.2.0

- Solana command routing and Solana CAIP parsing.
- Kamino lending/yield provider.
- Jupiter swap provider.
- Newer lend/yield retrieval ID fields (`provider_native_id`, `provider_native_id_kind`).
- Bridge quote `fee_breakdown` output.

## Practical guidance

- Pin your binary when automating docs + CLI together:

```bash
defi version --long
```

- If your scripts expect newer fields/commands, upgrade the binary first or switch your docs version picker to `latest` and then upgrade accordingly.
