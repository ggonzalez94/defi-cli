## Provider matrix

| Provider | Capabilities | Key required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `defillama` | chains, protocols, lend/yield fallback, bridge analytics | Route-specific |
| `aave` | lend, yield | No |
| `morpho` | lend, yield | No |
| `across` | bridge quote | No |
| `lifi` | bridge quote | No |
| `1inch` | swap quote | Yes |
| `uniswap` | swap quote | Yes |

## Key-gated routes

- `swap quote --provider 1inch` -> `DEFI_1INCH_API_KEY`
- `swap quote --provider uniswap` -> `DEFI_UNISWAP_API_KEY`
- `chains assets` -> `DEFI_DEFILLAMA_API_KEY`
- `bridge list` -> `DEFI_DEFILLAMA_API_KEY`
- `bridge details` -> `DEFI_DEFILLAMA_API_KEY`

These requirements were driven by provider APIs, not CLI licensing.

## Routing notes

- `yield --providers` accepted provider names like `defillama,aave,morpho`.
- Lending and yield paths could route through DefiLlama fallback behavior when direct-provider paths were unavailable.
