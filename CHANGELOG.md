# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to `defi-cli` are documented in this file.

Format:
- Keep entries under `Unreleased` until a tag is cut.
- Group notes by section in this order: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Docs`, `Security`.
- Keep bullets short and focused on user impact.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Solana chain support in canonical ID parsing (`solana:<reference>`) and Solana CAIP-19 token parsing (`solana:<reference>/token:<mint>`).
- Direct Kamino adapter for `lend markets`, `lend rates`, and `yield opportunities` on Solana mainnet.
- Direct Jupiter swap adapter for Solana quotes, with optional `DEFI_JUPITER_API_KEY` support.

### Changed
- `swap quote` now defaults provider by chain family (`1inch` for EVM chains, `jupiter` for Solana).
- Added explicit chain-family validation across providers so unsupported EVM/Solana combinations fail with clear `unsupported` errors.
- DefiLlama lending fallback protocol matcher now recognizes `kamino`.

### Fixed
- Tightened direct lending asset matching to prefer canonical token address/mint over symbol-only matches, reducing false positives on similarly named assets.
- Improved Kamino reserve collection performance and reliability by fetching per-market metrics concurrently while preserving deterministic output ordering.

### Docs
- Updated README and AGENTS guidance for Solana usage, Kamino/Jupiter providers, and API key semantics.

### Security
- None yet.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Added `chains assets` to return chain-level TVL broken down by asset, with optional `--asset` filtering.
- Added broader EVM `--chain` support across lending, yield, bridge, swap, and asset helpers.
- Added full support for Mantle, Ink, Scroll, Gnosis, Linea, Sonic, Celo, and zkSync Era, including bootstrap token registry coverage (`USDC`/`USDT`/`WETH`, where available) and verified provider coverage.
- Added partial support for Berachain, Blast, Fraxtal, and World Chain via chain normalization and routing support.
- Added partial Taiko support with first-class bootstrap asset parsing for `USDC` and `WETH` from official network contracts, plus `taiko alethia` alias normalization.

### Changed
- DefiLlama provider capability metadata now marks `chains.assets` as requiring `DEFI_DEFILLAMA_API_KEY`.
- `version`, `schema`, and `providers list` now bypass cache initialization so metadata commands are not blocked by cache path failures.

### Fixed
- Preserved provider statuses, warnings, and `meta.partial=true` in strict-mode partial-result error envelopes (exit code `15`).
- Prevented unsafe DefiLlama symbol matching when asset symbols are unresolved, including skipping unsafe lending fallback/provider selection paths.

### Docs
- Documented `chains assets` API key requirement alongside other key-gated commands in README and AGENTS.
- Documented metadata-command cache bypass and unresolved-symbol fallback caveats in `README.md`/`AGENTS.md`.

### Security
- None yet.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- Installer now defaults to writable user-space `PATH` locations and does not use `sudo` unless explicitly requested.

### Docs
- Refreshed README structure and feature overview.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- First tagged release of `defi-cli`.
- Core command surface for chains, protocols, assets, lending, yield, bridge, and swap workflows.
- Stable JSON envelope output and deterministic exit code contract for automation.

### Changed
- Project/module path migrated to `github.com/ggonzalez94/defi-cli`.
