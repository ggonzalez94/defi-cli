- Keep bullets short and focused on user impact.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- None yet.

### Changed
- `version`, `schema`, and `providers list` now bypass cache initialization so metadata commands are not blocked by cache path failures.

### Fixed
- Preserved provider statuses, warnings, and `meta.partial=true` in strict-mode partial-result error envelopes (exit code `15`).
- Prevented unsafe DefiLlama symbol matching when asset symbols are unresolved, including skipping unsafe lending fallback/provider selection paths.

### Docs
- Documented metadata-command cache bypass and unresolved-symbol fallback caveats in `README.md`/`AGENTS.md`.

### Security
- None yet.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- Installer now defaults to writable user-space `PATH` locations and does not use `sudo` unless explicitly requested.

### Docs
- Refreshed README structure and feature overview.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- First tagged release of `defi-cli`.
- Core command surface for chains, protocols, assets, lending, yield, bridge, and swap workflows.
- Stable JSON envelope output and deterministic exit code contract for automation.

### Changed
- Project/module path migrated to `github.com/ggonzalez94/defi-cli`.
