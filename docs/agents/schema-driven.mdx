title: Schema-Driven Integration
description: Use the machine-readable command schema to generate dynamic tooling.

## Fetch schema

```bash
defi schema --results-only
```

Scope to a specific command path:

```bash
defi schema "yield opportunities" --results-only
defi schema "bridge quote" --results-only
```

## Schema model

Each node contains:

- `path`
- `use`
- `short`
- `flags[]` (`name`, `type`, `usage`, `default`, optional `shorthand`)
- `subcommands[]`

## Practical uses

- Generate UI forms from flag metadata.
- Validate requested flags before execution.
- Produce autocomplete for command builders.
- Build policy-aware execution layers with `--enable-commands`.

## Notes

- Hidden commands are not included.
- Flag defaults are serialized as strings in schema output.
- Runtime constraints (for example, mutually exclusive amount flags) still require command execution validation.
