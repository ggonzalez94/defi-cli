## Stable mapping

| Exit code | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | success | Command succeeded |
| `1` | internal_error | Internal execution error |
| `2` | usage_error | Invalid command or flags |
| `10` | auth_error | Missing/invalid provider key |
| `11` | rate_limited | Provider throttling |
| `12` | provider_unavailable | Provider unavailable |
| `13` | unsupported | Unsupported input/provider pair |
| `14` | stale_data | Stale data beyond configured budget |
| `15` | partial_results | Partial results with `--strict` |
| `16` | command_blocked | Blocked by `--enable-commands` policy |

## Error handling recommendation

- Parse stderr envelope on non-zero exits.
- Branch logic on `error.code`.
- Use retries only for transient types (`11`, `12`).
